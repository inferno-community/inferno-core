    title 'Single Patient API'
    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      For each of the relevant USCDI data elements provided in the
      conformance statement, this test executes the [required supported
      searches](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CapabilityStatement-us-core-server.html)
      as defined by the US Core Implementation Guide v3.1.  The test begins
      by searching by one or more patients, with the expectation that the
      Bearer token provided to the test grants access to all USCDI
      resources. It uses results returned from that query to generate other
      queries and checks that the results are consistent with the provided
      search parameters.  It then performs a read on each Resource returned
      and validates the response against the relevant
      [profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/profiles.html) as currently
      defined in the US Core Implementation Guide. All MUST SUPPORT elements
      must be seen before the test can pass, as well as Data Absent Reason
      to demonstrate that the server can properly handle missing data. Note that
      Encounter, Organization and Practitioner resources must be accessible as
      references in some US Core profiles to satisfy must support
      requirements, and those references will be validated to their US Core profile.
      These resources will not be tested for FHIR search support.
